## How

Fork this repository, add your entry, then open a pull request https://github.com/lukal-x/awesome-balkan-produchunt/pulls.

I've added some products myself, those I've recently discovered that fit the loose criteria of being a digital product and its origin(ator) being "the region" or as I've recently taken to calling it, EXYU±.
